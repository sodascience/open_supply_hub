### Description

We have downloaded global supply chain data from the [Open Supply Hub](https://opensupplyhub.org) website via an API. The data is in the form of several files in JSON format. We want to represent this information in the form of a CSV file. Each row of this CSV file contains the brand, supplier, and several other properties of the supplier.
